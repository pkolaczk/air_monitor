# BasicValidationUsingHinnantDateTest

This unit test compares the DST transitions calculated by the
`BasicZoneProcessor` class (which uses the `zonedb` data files) with the
`validation_data.cpp` file generated by the
`../../tools/cpp/test_data_generator` program which uses the [Hinnant Date
Library](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date).

## Running the Test

Assuming that you have `g++` and `make` installed, just type:
```
$ make clean && make -j 4
$ ./BasicValidationUsingHinnantDateTest.out
TestRunner started on 268 test(s).
Test TransitionTest_Africa_Abidjan passed.
...
Test TransitionTest_Pacific_Wallis passed.
TestRunner duration: 0.070 seconds.
TestRunner summary: 268 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 timed out, out of 268 test(s).
```

## Compiling the HinnantDate Test Data Generator

The `Makefile` assumes that you have already compiled the
`../../../tools/cpp/test_data_generator.out` program. Type the following:

```
$ cd ../../../tools/cpp
$ make
```
